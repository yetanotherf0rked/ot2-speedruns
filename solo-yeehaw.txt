Notes:
- 38:54 run here 
https://youtu.be/Z-exSKEr9JY
- splits.io here
https://splits.io/asmb (Sum of Best is actually 36-ish)
- most ideas come from jelloknifee's run, thanks to him!
https://www.speedrun.com/octopath2/run/zg24prjy
- 37-mins pace route
- inventor route
- no black market route
- risky route, you'll need luck to avoid game overs
--- force 1 encounter before scholar
--- 2 turn order specific requirements for Thurston and Final Boss
--- 1 non-consistent HHB x4 for Garnet (rich doggo)
--- at least 2 long segments with no autosave
--- sub-40 <=> at least less than 5 game overs
- AoF stands for Arrow of Fortune
- flee means: break & flee (b&f) if same/high level enemy, or just flee if low level enemy/many enemies unbreakable simultaneously/surprise attack
- you'll need to grind some extra JP (20ish) before getting to the Scholar's Guild (2/3 encounters using AoF)
- if simple cait encounter:
--- before Scholar: no JP grinding
--- before Wellgrove: skip Secret Forest 10000L chest (high ambush-rate area) and take the Magus Knife (sells for 5000L) chest outside Wellgrove (at least 40 seconds save)

Money Requirements:
- 15000L for Garnet
- 104800L for the ship
- 60000L for Thurston
- at (very least) 21000L for 3 Roque Island encounters (29000L is safe, 37000L is even better)
- there's a 24500L chest just before the boss
- 30000L for Final Boss

Note: the beastlings dmg is unconsistent, Garnet can have 2000 to 4000 HP left after HHB x4
Alternative: jelloknifee's strat uses Scholar's Elemental Barrage + Summon's Axe attacks to break Garnet and uses HHG x4 when broken (8000L save). I use HHB x4 cuz it's faster (but riskier).

- if not done yet: Unlock Sidestep and Equip Boost Start

head to Alrond's Estate

=====================
HIDDEN IN STEAM:
=====================
---------------
BOSS: Thurston + Steam Engine or sth
---------------
T1 HHB x3 on steam engine
T2 skip dialogue/LP + HHB x4
T3 HHV x3

Note: if Thurston acts before you at T2, it's a 95% (invented figure) chance of dying. I noticed Thurston sometimes doesn't oneshot you with his 3 hits attack when summoning someone (to be confirmed). Maybe something to experiment with Sidesteps as well.

=====================
2 EMPOWERING:
=====================
skip cutscenes
go to the department store
Buy: 2 Empowering Bracelets for 5000L each from the Merchant east of the Department
equip them (you can fast equip on both slots)
- select to equip 1st
- press P/Start to switch 2nd slot (Battle Speed Button)
- select to equip 2nd
b1g g4ym1ng m0ment
warp Beasting Bay Harbor

=====================
ROQUE ISLAND:
=====================
Note: at this point, if you're under 33 (maybe under 34) here on 120FPS, PC, sub-40 is possible
Note 2: starting from this point, you'll have 3 encounters if you time your runs/walks well
you can safely use 1 HHB
I didn't test if you can use 2 HHB
If you use 3 HHB, you'll turn out of money before the final boss (need 30000L)
you can still go with an early Collect on final boss but tbh, I wouldn't risk it

sail to Roque Island (run)
run, 1 encounter (HHB x3 OR Any M + HHG x4 if lucky turn order and greedy on leaves)
start walking after the first stairs (low chance getting a 2nd encounter)
in Roque Island:
start ch.4
sleep at the inn/use Empowering Lychee M x2 for LP if you still have them
continue with the story and make for the Headquarters

=====================
DON'T GET AMBUSHED: long 2 encounters segment with no autosave, good luck
=====================
once in Headquerters
run 1st screen
1 encounter: HHG x4 is often enough
start walking when you climbed down the two consecutive ladders
run 2nd screen (outside)
run 3rd screen and take the money chest behind the middle door
Chest: 24500L
keep running
1 encounter: HHG x4 is often enough
go to the ground floor
take the chest behind the east door
Chest: Refreshing Jam
before going to next screen:

MENU:
- Unlock Any Merch Skill
- Equip Hang Tough
- Make sure you're full LP/health with both Empowering Bracelets equipped

head to Roque
buy the 80 billion contract
next fight is not a 100% chance win so if you don't wanna risk, go back previous screen to trigger autosave, (I tend to skip it)

=====================
FORBES TOP 1: need 30000L here
=====================
---------------
BOSS: not the phantom train or sth
---------------
Default is: Partitio acts before Cannon (leaves you with 1HP) and Glacis Plate (his Brush Aside attack make you act at the end of the turn), both can be Sidestepped
T1: HHRx3
T2: LP+HHVx4
T3/4: heal/sidestep/boost
T4/5: Collect x4 for 52000L +  (Collect x3 works with a ~70% chance)
T5/6: Boost (Reinforcing Jam)
T6/7: HHR x3
T7/8: HHV x4
T8/9: Defend/heal/sidestep/skip dialogue
T8/9: Finish him with HHV x4

Notes:
- debuff is mandatory for oneshooting the train's mininons with HHVx4 / you can also do HHBx3 then HHBx4 (see jelloknifee's route)
- overall, train only needs 2 debuffed HHVx4 and 1 non debuffed HHVx4 (make the 3 of them debuffed if you want more consistency)
- make sure you're ready to HHVx4 after a Repairs, or Partitio gets out of the game
- if you made him eat 3 HHVx4 before skipping dialogue, just finish him with Polearm x1 (classy m0ment)
- maybe some optimization to do here

skip cutscene
switch to night
Hire: Roque for 1L
skip cutscenes
