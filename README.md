=== doubt is what he does
    
    == 1st phase:
    - summon Fisherman, Prayer to the Flame x2, break & HHV x4
    (WARNING: don't do HHV x4 if she's still debuffed)
    This does less than 40k damage
    - summon Fisherman again, heal/sidestep/atk/mystical staff until she's 1 SP
    - make sure you're full BP & at least 1400HP (Rev Jam if needed)
    - then: HHB x3 & HHV x4 (This does up to 60k damage) 

    == IMPORTANT NOTE N°1
    WARNING: it can do less damage, two of your HHV attacks must do at least 9999 or next step will be harder. If you want to make sure you do max damage here, go with this (harder to nail):
    - she has 1 SP & you're at least 2000HP and 3BP
    - do HHR x4, Rev Jam, HHB x3 and HHV x4. This way you're sure she only have something like 8000HP left for the following step.

    == IMPORTANT NOTE N°2
    If Fisherman breaks her, just repeat, don't damage her yet.
    If Fisherman leaves while she's 2-5SP, break her manually (atk, mystical staff)
    If Fisherman leaves while she's 5+ SP, you can summon him again, but make sure you're ready to act (full BP and 2/3 HP at least) for breaking her.
    If she's 1SP, and you're full BP and 2/3 HP left, it's time to strike.

    == 2nd phase:
    - Heal/Boost (Rev Jam) & HHV x4 (13000 dmg)
    Note: if you used HHR in previous step, HHV x3 is enough (9000 dmg)

    skip cutscenes
    gg!

Without Aelfric

the idea is to:

Phase 1:
- break and deal a bit less damage than 40k
- heal, rebreak and deal as much damage as u can,
she would then ideally be -(38k+40k)=22k hp left (HHB damage non taken into account)
* with HHBx3 during breaking phase, you can do 4 to 9k damage so this would give in the bcs:
-(38k+40k+9k)=13k hp left for phase 2.

Phase 2:
- non-broken,	HHVx4 does 12k dmg
		HHAx4 does 16k to 18k dmg
- broken?????? 
she's 13 shield, she acts 4 times a turn, she deals heavy damage, I won't even think about breaking it.
the best you can do is to have a summon that does -3/-4/-5 SP + breaking her with simple attacks (needs BP) or LP+mystical staff (-2)
So you can break her shield in 3 or 4 turns

I went for Aelfric + Veterans but I should probably try No Aelfric as well.

+ She's vulnerable to light 2nd phase so a Light L/Luminescence + Hallowed Rod + Evening Mist must deal a lot of damage

-------------------------------------------------------

HH damage dealt (Aelfric)

=== Breaking Phase

Kaldena (T2 non-broken debuff)
HHB ~2,100/hit

Kaldena (T2 broken debuff)
HHB ~3,400/hit

So depending on remaining Shield Points, damage dealt would be:

0 SP (Worst Case Scenario)

If she's already broken at the beginning of T2, T2 & T2A would be her only DPS phase. Depending on how much BP do you have (4 or 5 as Hollowed Night removes 1 BP), you would only do:
T2 HHV x4 & T2A HHV x2 or x3
And when she's about 60% HP, she goes berserk so not ideal.

If you're full BP (HHB x3):
3 SP	2,100*3 +		= ~6,300
2 SP	2,100*2 + 3,400	= ~7,600
1 SP	3,400*2 + 2,100 	= ~8,900 (bcs)

If you have 4 BP (HHB x2):
3 SP	like 2 SP but pray that summon acts again
2 SP	~2,100*2 		= ~4,200
1 SP	~2,100 + 3,400 	= ~5,500

=== DPS Phase using HHV

T2A broken debuff
HHV 9,999/hit
So HHVx4 = 39,996

T3A broken no debuff
HHV 8,750 / 8,900 / 8,900 / 9,999
So HHVx4 = 36,499

=== Recap using HHV

T2A + T3A			= ~76,500

With full BP at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	3 SP	= ~82,800
			2 SP	= ~84,100
			1 SP	= ~85,400 (bcs)


With 4 BP only at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	2 SP	= ~80,700
			1 SP	= ~82,000

=== Finish Her Phase (Kaldena of Night)

non-broken, pdef buff

HHB 1600*4
HHV 3700*3 + 2900 = 14000
HHA 4500*4 = 18000

-------------------------------------------------------
No Aelfric No Assassins Tests

1.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 3600 = 25200 (say 27000 to be sure)
	4800*2 = 9600
		34800
don't reach 35k damage yet

DPS 2
then full dmg
1 SP HHB x3 (breaks)
2400 + 4800 + 4800 = 12000
HHV x3
8500*4 = 34000
* actually 8600*2 + 8900*2 = 35000 (so 31k left)

Overall total: 34800 + 34000 = 68000
still 32k hp 2nd phase (yellow)

DPS 3
use light?
f this
brb
-------------------------------------------------------
2.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 9400 = 31k

DPS 2
dead
-------------------------------------------------------
3.
DPS 1
7200*2 + 7400*2 = 29200 

DPS 2
8600*3 + 8900 = 34700

total 63900
34k hp left
tf
-------------------------------------------------------
4.
DPS 1
7300 7200 9200 7400 = 31100 hp

DPS 2
dead
-------------------------------------------------------
5. 
DPS 1
~28k

DPS 2
7400 + 9999 + 8900*3
~44k dmg

28k hp left

DPS 3
3800*2 2900*2 = 13400
-------------------------------------------------------

Assassins No Aelfric

Assassins Cost
15k + 30k

Kaldena 1st phase
either
15k (HHB x4 debuffed)
or
30k (HHV x3)

Kaldena 2nd phase
should be 30k HP left
HHA x4 ~ 17k damage
so need HHA twice
2*HHA = 100k leaves
100 + 30 = 130k leaves
+ 45k leaves to get the assassins
= 175k leaves for final boss (such money is as painful as JP to grind)
