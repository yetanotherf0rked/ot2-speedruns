=== pretty pearl
	from here you'll need 175k
	45 for the assassins
	and 130 for final boss
	at this point of my 2nd run I'm at 100k
	and there's a 28k L chests in ch.5
	so need 37k more
		I would suggest going for the pretty pearl quest in tropuhopu 
		Elderly Man looking at the sea (Hidden Item: Pretty Pearl)
	+ ch.5 encounters give 2k money per battle
	they are either one shotable with changeable cat
	or changeable cat + soulstone
	must have Victory Ring equipped and fight by night
	and there will be 4-6 encounters 
	sell stuff (I keep giant club & lost axe though)
	also make sure you have the suggested equipment
	if you want to go with different gear
	prioritize optimization:
		HP then
		P.DEF and then
		M.DEF

=== apolitical night owls
	I used HHBx4 then HHVx3
	with Temenos' night debuff
	no Summon
	Maybe there's some money optimization to do here

=== no gps signal zone
	nameless village
	start ch4
	Wandering Wood
	right then left, skip cutscene then right
	skip cutscene and tp nameless village
	take the beastling and back to wood
	equip victory ring, inventor setup, night
	28k chest, Light Soulstone L
	Rifted Rock, chests:
		Revitalizing Jam (you may need this)
		Hallowed Rod
		Void Amulet
	prepare for kaldena, gear I used at lvl 30:
	
	Merch

	Step Ahead
	Hale and Hearty
	Boost Start
	Upgraded Accessories

	Polearm		None
	Bow			Evening Mist
	Staff		Giant's Club
	Shield		Quartz (balanced)
	Accessory 1	Empowering Necklace
	Accessory 2	Empowering Bracelet
	
	I didn't test at mid-20 yet

=== doubt is what I do
	make sure it's night and that you have healing items (jams, Poms, Red Apples)
	Phase 1:
		Summon Fisherman
		break & deal less than 35k damage
			HHB x4 broken debuffed does 31/32k
			HHV x3 broken debbufed does 30k
			HHV x3 broken non-debuffed does 27k (so better go with HHBx2 to brk+deal dmg, and then HHBx4 to reach 32k)
		heal somewhere here
		Summon Fisherman again
		break & deal as much dmg as u can
			I never had her debuffed on this stage as I was always either lacking HP or BP or sth else
			Ideal would be that she's debuffed, you're nearly full HP, she has 1 SP left, break with HHB x3 and tank with HHV x4, should do around 50/60k dmg
			of course u can use assassins if you have extra money
	Phase 2:
		should be 35k to 20k hp left
		don't break, don't debuff (useless)
		boost + use assassins twice (16k damage)
		HEAL

	expensive for now, maybe better way

	more details below

With Aelfric

With Assassins (Overall Cost: 150-175k)

===== Phase 1
T0	2BP - Summon (8 SP)		
T1	3BP - Aelfric (5 SP)		
T1A	0BP - Pom L (2 SP)		
T2	5BP - Break Kaldena with HHG x3		
T2A	3BP - HHA x4		
T3	0BP - Pom L		
T3A	4BP - HHA x4

===== Phase 2		
T4 	1BP - Defend/Heal/Pom M
Either
T5	HHB x3
Or
T5	1 Light L
T6	any L or HHG x3	

With Veterans (Overall cost: 115-130k)

===== Phase 1
T0	2BP - Summon (8 SP)		
T1	3BP - Aelfric (5 SP)		
T1A	0BP - Pom L (2 SP)		
T2	5BP - Break with HHG x3		
T2A	3BP - HHV x4		
T3	0BP - Pom L		
T3A	4BP - HHV x4

-------------------------------------------------------

Without Aelfric

the idea is to:

Phase 1:
- break and deal a bit less damage than 40k
- heal, rebreak and deal as much damage as u can,
she would then ideally be -(38k+40k)=22k hp left (HHB damage non taken into account)
* with HHBx3 during breaking phase, you can do 4 to 9k damage so this would give in the bcs:
-(38k+40k+9k)=13k hp left for phase 2.

Phase 2:
- non-broken,	HHVx4 does 12k dmg
		HHAx4 does 16k to 18k dmg
- broken?????? 
she's 13 shield, she acts 4 times a turn, she deals heavy damage, I won't even think about breaking it.
the best you can do is to have a summon that does -3/-4/-5 SP + breaking her with simple attacks (needs BP) or LP+mystical staff (-2)
So you can break her shield in 3 or 4 turns

I went for Aelfric + Veterans but I should probably try No Aelfric as well.

+ She's vulnerable to light 2nd phase so a Light L/Luminescence + Hallowed Rod + Evening Mist must deal a lot of damage

-------------------------------------------------------

HH damage dealt (Aelfric)

=== Breaking Phase

Kaldena (T2 non-broken debuff)
HHB ~2,100/hit

Kaldena (T2 broken debuff)
HHB ~3,400/hit

So depending on remaining Shield Points, damage dealt would be:

0 SP (Worst Case Scenario)

If she's already broken at the beginning of T2, T2 & T2A would be her only DPS phase. Depending on how much BP do you have (4 or 5 as Hollowed Night removes 1 BP), you would only do:
T2 HHV x4 & T2A HHV x2 or x3
And when she's about 60% HP, she goes berserk so not ideal.

If you're full BP (HHB x3):
3 SP	2,100*3 +		= ~6,300
2 SP	2,100*2 + 3,400	= ~7,600
1 SP	3,400*2 + 2,100 	= ~8,900 (bcs)

If you have 4 BP (HHB x2):
3 SP	like 2 SP but pray that summon acts again
2 SP	~2,100*2 		= ~4,200
1 SP	~2,100 + 3,400 	= ~5,500

=== DPS Phase using HHV

T2A broken debuff
HHV 9,999/hit
So HHVx4 = 39,996

T3A broken no debuff
HHV 8,750 / 8,900 / 8,900 / 9,999
So HHVx4 = 36,499

=== Recap using HHV

T2A + T3A			= ~76,500

With full BP at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	3 SP	= ~82,800
			2 SP	= ~84,100
			1 SP	= ~85,400 (bcs)


With 4 BP only at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	2 SP	= ~80,700
			1 SP	= ~82,000

=== Finish Her Phase (Kaldena of Night)

non-broken, pdef buff

HHB 1600*4
HHV 3700*3 + 2900 = 14000
HHA 4500*4 = 18000

-------------------------------------------------------
No Aelfric No Assassins Tests

1.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 3600 = 25200 (say 27000 to be sure)
	4800*2 = 9600
		34800
don't reach 35k damage yet

DPS 2
then full dmg
1 SP HHB x3 (breaks)
2400 + 4800 + 4800 = 12000
HHV x3
8500*4 = 34000
* actually 8600*2 + 8900*2 = 35000 (so 31k left)

Overall total: 34800 + 34000 = 68000
still 32k hp 2nd phase (yellow)

DPS 3
use light?
f this
brb
-------------------------------------------------------
2.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 9400 = 31k

DPS 2
dead
-------------------------------------------------------
3.
DPS 1
7200*2 + 7400*2 = 29200 

DPS 2
8600*3 + 8900 = 34700

total 63900
34k hp left
tf
-------------------------------------------------------
4.
DPS 1
7300 7200 9200 7400 = 31100 hp

DPS 2
dead
-------------------------------------------------------
5. 
DPS 1
~28k

DPS 2
7400 + 9999 + 8900*3
~44k dmg

28k hp left

DPS 3
3800*2 2900*2 = 13400
-------------------------------------------------------

Assassins No Aelfric

Assassins Cost
15k + 30k

Kaldena 1st phase
either
15k (HHB x4 debuffed)
or
30k (HHV x3)

Kaldena 2nd phase
should be 30k HP left
HHA x4 ~ 17k damage
so need HHA twice
2*HHA = 100k leaves
100 + 30 = 130k leaves
+ 45k leaves to get the assassins
= 175k leaves for final boss (such money is as painful as JP to grind)
