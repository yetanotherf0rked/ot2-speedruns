## Thoughts
Tested this:
```
felvarg ~2200L (need LP next)
pretty pearl ~15k (2200 + 15000 - 1500 + enc)
soulstones ~25k (sell mirage bow & herb)
evasive (need LP next)
winterbloom (go to inn here)
abandoned chest
montwise (need LP here)
crackridge
merch/gravell
timberain I
merry hills (empowering, herb)
canalbrine I, take castti (ch.2 until lucian house)
soothe guard
canabrine II, deposit castti, take rich father and go for vados
New Delsta I (rich father, unerring, killer's motive, victory)
conning creek (grape guy, apothecary, rainbow)
timberain II (proof of justice)
stormhail
clockbank
inventor
ch.3
ravine
full gear
assassins
ch.4
nameless village
```
- and going Inventor last is a bad idea, loses a lot of time & money.
- do we really need Upgraded Accessories? It costs 35k to get. But makes you gain 750HP for two last bosses.

        T3 Collect x4 (Broken)

        T6 HHR x3
        T7 HHB x4
        T8 Pom M/L
        T9 HHB x3

NOTE:
	from here you'll need 175k
	45 for the assassins
	and 110 to  for final boss
	at this point of my 2nd run I'm at 100k
	and there's a 28k L chests in ch.5
	so need 37k more
	+ ch.5 encounters give 2k money per battle
	they are either one shotable with changeable cat
	or changeable cat + soulstone
	must have Victory Ring equipped and fight by night
	and there will be 4-6 encounters 
	sell stuff (I keep giant club & lost axe though)
	also make sure you have the suggested equipment
	if you want to go with different gear
	prioritize optimization:
		HP then
		P.DEF and then
		M.DEF

=== apolitical night owls
	I used HHBx4 then HHVx3
	with Temenos' night debuff
	no Summon
	Maybe there's some money optimization to do here

=== no gps signal zone
	nameless village
	start ch4
	== Wandering Wood:
    right then left x2
	tp nameless village
	take the beastling and back to wood
    Chest: 28k
    Chest: Light Soulstone (L)
	== Rifted Rocks:
	Chest: Revitalizing Jam (you may need this)

=== getting prepared
	prepare for kaldena, gear I used at lvl 30:
	
	Merch

	Step Ahead
	Hale and Hearty
	Boost Start
	Upgraded Accessories

	Polearm		Whatever Bow			Whatever
	Staff		Whatever (maybe Hallowed Rod can be userful?)
    Armor       .
    Head        .
	Shield		Quartz Shield
	Accessory 1	Empowering Necklace
	Accessory 2	Empowering Bracelet
	
	make sure it's night and that you have healing items (jams, Poms, Red Apples)

    In Best Case Scenario, you'll use:
    First phase: HHB three times, HHV once
    Second phase: HHA once
    
    If not you would probably use either HHA twice or HHA+HHV second phase.

=== doubt is what I do

    Kaldena (100000HP)

	Phase 1: (Cost 75k)
		1. Summon Fisherman
		2. break & deal less than 35k damage
			HHB x4 broken debuffed does 31/32k
			HHV x3 broken debbufed does 30k
			HHV x3 broken non-debuffed does 27k (so better go with HHBx2 to brk+deal dmg, and then HHBx4 to reach 32k)
		3. Summon Fisherman again
        4. heal somewhere here
		5. break & deal as much dmg as u can
			
        Note: I never had her debuffed on this stage as I was always either lacking HP or BP or sth else
		Ideal would be that she's debuffed, you're nearly full HP, she has 1 SP left, break with HHB x3 and tank with HHV x4, should do around 50/60k dmg

	Phase 2: should be 35k to 20k hp left (Cost: 50/80/100k)
		don't break, don't debuff (useless)
		1. Boost/Heal (Rev Jam/Pom L/Red Apple)
        2. If Terror, use Wriggling Root
        3. HHA x4
        4. if still alive, boost/heal and either HHV x4 or HHAx4 (if you have 50k)

	expensive for now, maybe better way

	more details below

With Aelfric

With Assassins (Overall Cost: 150-175k)

T1	3BP - Aelfric (5 SP)		
T1A	0BP - Pom L (2 SP)		
T2	5BP - Break Kaldena with HHG x3		
T2A	3BP - HHA x4		
T3	0BP - Pom L

===== Phase 2		
T4 	1BP - Defend/Heal/Pom M
Either
T5	HHB x3
Or
T5	1 Light L
T6	any L or HHG x3	

With Veterans (Overall cost: 115-130k)

===== Phase 1
T0	2BP - Summon (8 SP)		
T1	3BP - Aelfric (5 SP)		
T1A	0BP - Pom L (2 SP)		
T2	5BP - Break with HHG x3		
T2A	3BP - HHV x4		
T3	0BP - Pom L		
T3A	4BP - HHV x4

-------------------------------------------------------

Without Aelfric

the idea is to:

Phase 1:
- break and deal a bit less damage than 40k
- heal, rebreak and deal as much damage as u can,
she would then ideally be -(38k+40k)=22k hp left (HHB damage non taken into account)
* with HHBx3 during breaking phase, you can do 4 to 9k damage so this would give in the bcs:
-(38k+40k+9k)=13k hp left for phase 2.

Phase 2:
- non-broken,	HHVx4 does 12k dmg
		HHAx4 does 16k to 18k dmg
- broken?????? 
she's 13 shield, she acts 4 times a turn, she deals heavy damage, I won't even think about breaking it.
the best you can do is to have a summon that does -3/-4/-5 SP + breaking her with simple attacks (needs BP) or LP+mystical staff (-2)
So you can break her shield in 3 or 4 turns

I went for Aelfric + Veterans but I should probably try No Aelfric as well.

+ She's vulnerable to light 2nd phase so a Light L/Luminescence + Hallowed Rod + Evening Mist must deal a lot of damage

-------------------------------------------------------

HH damage dealt (Aelfric)

=== Breaking Phase

Kaldena (T2 non-broken debuff)
HHB ~2,100/hit

Kaldena (T2 broken debuff)
HHB ~3,400/hit

So depending on remaining Shield Points, damage dealt would be:

0 SP (Worst Case Scenario)

If she's already broken at the beginning of T2, T2 & T2A would be her only DPS phase. Depending on how much BP do you have (4 or 5 as Hollowed Night removes 1 BP), you would only do:
T2 HHV x4 & T2A HHV x2 or x3
And when she's about 60% HP, she goes berserk so not ideal.

If you're full BP (HHB x3):
3 SP	2,100*3 +		= ~6,300
2 SP	2,100*2 + 3,400	= ~7,600
1 SP	3,400*2 + 2,100 	= ~8,900 (bcs)

If you have 4 BP (HHB x2):
3 SP	like 2 SP but pray that summon acts again
2 SP	~2,100*2 		= ~4,200
1 SP	~2,100 + 3,400 	= ~5,500

=== DPS Phase using HHV

T2A broken debuff
HHV 9,999/hit
So HHVx4 = 39,996

T3A broken no debuff
HHV 8,750 / 8,900 / 8,900 / 9,999
So HHVx4 = 36,499

=== Recap using HHV

T2A + T3A			= ~76,500

With full BP at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	3 SP	= ~82,800
			2 SP	= ~84,100
			1 SP	= ~85,400 (bcs)


With 4 BP only at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	2 SP	= ~80,700
			1 SP	= ~82,000

=== Finish Her Phase (Kaldena of Night)

non-broken, pdef buff

HHB 1600*4
HHV 3700*3 + 2900 = 14000
HHA 4500*4 = 18000

-------------------------------------------------------
No Aelfric No Assassins Tests

1.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 3600 = 25200 (say 27000 to be sure)
	4800*2 = 9600
		34800
don't reach 35k damage yet

DPS 2
then full dmg
1 SP HHB x3 (breaks)
2400 + 4800 + 4800 = 12000
HHV x3
8500*4 = 34000
* actually 8600*2 + 8900*2 = 35000 (so 31k left)

Overall total: 34800 + 34000 = 68000
still 32k hp 2nd phase (yellow)

Assassins No Aelfric

Assassins Cost
15k + 30k

Kaldena 1st phase
either
15k (HHB x4 debuffed)
or
30k (HHV x3)

Kaldena 2nd phase
should be 30k HP left
HHA x4 ~ 17k damage
so need HHA twice
2*HHA = 100k leaves
100 + 30 = 130k leaves
+ 45k leaves to get the assassins
= 175k leaves for final boss (such money is as painful as JP to grind)
