	make sure it's night and that you have healing items (jams, Poms, Red Apples)

=== doubt is what I do

    Kaldena (100k HP)

	Phase 1: (Cost 75k)
		1. Summon Fisherman
		2. break & deal less than ~40k damage
        I let Fisherman break her shield while I heal/Boost and when she's broken I go for HHVx4
		3. Summon Fisherman again
		4. break & deal as much dmg as u can
        What I do here is that I wait until her shield is 1 or near 1. At this point, Fisherman has to be retreated (so he doesn't break her yet), you should have at least 2/3 HP and full BP. When these conditions are reunited, go for:
        HHV x3 (breaks)
        HHV x4 (when broken)
        This will deal about ~55k dmg

        HHV x3 breaks her shield at the first hit as the first weapon to be used is a spear (to be verified)

	Phase 2: 
        Here she acts 3 times in a turn, she hits hard, and she can inflict Terror, use Wriggling Root (heals + cures) if that happens
        If you dealt enough damage in 1st phase
        Boost (Rev Jam or Red Apple) & HHV x4 will be enough
        If not, go for HHV/HHB again if enough money or use L Soulstones 

        skip cutscenes
        gg

Either
T5	HHB x3
Or
T5	1 Light L
T6	any L or HHG x3	

With Veterans (Overall cost: 115-130k)

===== Phase 1
T0	2BP - Summon (8 SP)		
T1	3BP - Aelfric (5 SP)		
T1A	0BP - Pom L (2 SP)		
T2	5BP - Break with HHG x3		
T2A	3BP - HHV x4		
T3	0BP - Pom L		
T3A	4BP - HHV x4

-------------------------------------------------------

Without Aelfric

the idea is to:

Phase 1:
- break and deal a bit less damage than 40k
- heal, rebreak and deal as much damage as u can,
she would then ideally be -(38k+40k)=22k hp left (HHB damage non taken into account)
* with HHBx3 during breaking phase, you can do 4 to 9k damage so this would give in the bcs:
-(38k+40k+9k)=13k hp left for phase 2.

Phase 2:
- non-broken,	HHVx4 does 12k dmg
		HHAx4 does 16k to 18k dmg
- broken?????? 
she's 13 shield, she acts 4 times a turn, she deals heavy damage, I won't even think about breaking it.
the best you can do is to have a summon that does -3/-4/-5 SP + breaking her with simple attacks (needs BP) or LP+mystical staff (-2)
So you can break her shield in 3 or 4 turns

I went for Aelfric + Veterans but I should probably try No Aelfric as well.

+ She's vulnerable to light 2nd phase so a Light L/Luminescence + Hallowed Rod + Evening Mist must deal a lot of damage

-------------------------------------------------------

HH damage dealt (Aelfric)

=== Breaking Phase

Kaldena (T2 non-broken debuff)
HHB ~2,100/hit

Kaldena (T2 broken debuff)
HHB ~3,400/hit

So depending on remaining Shield Points, damage dealt would be:

0 SP (Worst Case Scenario)

If she's already broken at the beginning of T2, T2 & T2A would be her only DPS phase. Depending on how much BP do you have (4 or 5 as Hollowed Night removes 1 BP), you would only do:
T2 HHV x4 & T2A HHV x2 or x3
And when she's about 60% HP, she goes berserk so not ideal.

If you're full BP (HHB x3):
3 SP	2,100*3 +		= ~6,300
2 SP	2,100*2 + 3,400	= ~7,600
1 SP	3,400*2 + 2,100 	= ~8,900 (bcs)

If you have 4 BP (HHB x2):
3 SP	like 2 SP but pray that summon acts again
2 SP	~2,100*2 		= ~4,200
1 SP	~2,100 + 3,400 	= ~5,500

=== DPS Phase using HHV

T2A broken debuff
HHV 9,999/hit
So HHVx4 = 39,996

T3A broken no debuff
HHV 8,750 / 8,900 / 8,900 / 9,999
So HHVx4 = 36,499

=== Recap using HHV

T2A + T3A			= ~76,500

With full BP at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	3 SP	= ~82,800
			2 SP	= ~84,100
			1 SP	= ~85,400 (bcs)


With 4 BP only at T2:
T2 + T2A + T3A 	2 SP	= ~80,700
			1 SP	= ~82,000

=== Finish Her Phase (Kaldena of Night)

non-broken, pdef buff

HHB 1600*4
HHV 3700*3 + 2900 = 14000
HHA 4500*4 = 18000

-------------------------------------------------------
No Aelfric No Assassins Tests

1.
DPS 1
7200*3 + 3600 = 25200 (say 27000 to be sure)
	4800*2 = 9600
		34800
don't reach 35k damage yet

DPS 2
then full dmg
1 SP HHB x3 (breaks)
2400 + 4800 + 4800 = 12000
HHV x3
8500*4 = 34000
* actually 8600*2 + 8900*2 = 35000 (so 31k left)

Overall total: 34800 + 34000 = 68000
still 32k hp 2nd phase (yellow)

use light?

Assassins No Aelfric

Assassins Cost
15k + 30k

Kaldena 1st phase
either
15k (HHB x4 debuffed)
or
30k (HHV x3)

Kaldena 2nd phase
should be 30k HP left
HHA x4 ~ 17k damage
so need HHA twice
2*HHA = 100k leaves
100 + 30 = 130k leaves
+ 45k leaves to get the assassins
= 175k leaves for final boss (such money is as painful as JP to grind)
